# Flappy-Bird
Flappy Bird​ is a mobile game developed by​ ​Vietnamese video game artist Dong Nguyen,  under his game development company​ ​dotGears​.​[1]​ The game is a​ ​side-scroller​ where the  player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting  them. If the player touches the pipes, they​ ​lose. Faby(the bird protagonist) briefly flaps  upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, Faby falls  because of​ ​gravity; each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single  point
